### **Project Description: Morse Code to Audio Encoder and Decoder GUI using Python**

The project demonstrates the development of a complete bi-directional Morse code communication system implemented in Python. The system is designed with an interactive graphical user interface (GUI) that allows users to seamlessly encode text messages into Morse code audio and decode Morse code audio files back into text, thereby bridging traditional communication methods with modern software applications.

The project is divided into two major parts:

**Part 1 – Morse Code Generator (Encoding):**
In this module, the user interacts with a GUI that enables the input of messages of up to 10 characters. Each character entered is instantly converted into its Morse code equivalent, which is displayed within the interface. Additionally, the system generates and plays an audio signal corresponding to the Morse code pattern of each letter. Once the entire message is constructed, the complete Morse code audio sequence is compiled and stored as a `.wav` file, ensuring the encoded message can be preserved and shared. This part highlights real-time text-to-Morse conversion, synchronized audio playback, and audio file generation.

**Part 2 – Morse Code Decoder (Decoding):**
The second module provides functionality to reverse the encoding process. Users can upload an audio file containing a Morse code message through the GUI. The system analyzes the uploaded sound file, processes the audio signals, and identifies the embedded Morse code patterns. These patterns are then mapped back to their respective characters, reconstructing the original text message. The decoded output is displayed in a text box within the interface, ensuring an intuitive user experience. This module emphasizes robust audio analysis, pattern recognition, and real-time decoding.

Overall, this project demonstrates a comprehensive integration of **signal processing, GUI design, and file handling in Python**, while showcasing both the historical significance of Morse code and its modern-day digital applications.
